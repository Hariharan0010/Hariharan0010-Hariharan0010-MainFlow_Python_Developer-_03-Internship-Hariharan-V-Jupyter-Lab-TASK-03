# Task 3: Basic Web Scraper using python

## Overview

This repository contains the work I completed for Task 3 of my Python Developer internship at **Main Flow Services and Technologies**. In this task, I created a basic web scraper using Python, focusing on extracting data from static web pages with the help of the BeautifulSoup library.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a simple web scraper that extracts specific information from a static web page. Web scraping is an essential skill for gathering data from websites, and this task helped me understand the fundamental principles and techniques involved in this process.

## Learning Objectives

- **Understand Web Scraping Principles:** Gain knowledge about how web scraping works and the ethical considerations involved.
- **Use Python Libraries:** Utilize Python libraries like BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML and extracting data.
- **Extract Data:** Develop a script to extract relevant information such as text, links, or images from web pages.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python 3.x**
- **BeautifulSoup:** A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
- **Requests:** A Python library to make HTTP requests for accessing web pages.


- **`web_scraper.py`**: The Python script for web scraping.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A list of dependencies required to run the script.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the script in this repository, you need the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x
- The Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Web Scraper

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-developer-internship.git
   cd python-developer-internship/Task3
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   python web_scraper.py
   ```

## Key Features

- **HTML Parsing:** Uses BeautifulSoup to parse HTML documents and navigate the parse tree.
- **Data Extraction:** Extracts specific information such as text, links, and images from static web pages.
- **Simple and Efficient:** Provides a straightforward approach to web scraping for beginners.


## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank **Main Flow Services and Technologies** for guiding me through this task and providing the opportunity to learn and grow as a developer.
